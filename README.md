### About Me

I am an experienced data scientist with a profound passion for data-related problem-solving. My expertise is in building sophisticated Machine Learning pipelines for solving real-life problems. In addition, I am passionate about teaching state-of-the-art data mining concepts to people, and this GitHub account is filled with fun examples of the Machine Learning approach to problem-solving.

I am also a third-year PhD student in the Computing PhD program (Data Science Emphasis) at [Boise State University](https://www.boisestate.edu/computing/directory/student-directory/ibrahim-olalekan-alabi/) where I use Machine Learning to improve snow products.
